# FPA-Analysis
This is part two of a two part learning process. The first project focused on learning SQL. Now with that understanding, I will be creating a new database with simplified data to chart financial metrics as well as plot predictions for different financial metrics via polynomial regression model.  


#### Here is an example output for profit margin based on 8 years of financial data used as input:
Predicted Profit Margins for the Next Five Years: <br>
Year: 9, Profit Margin: 0.36573928270780387 <br>
Year: 10, Profit Margin: 0.3757189555678242 <br>
Year: 11, Profit Margin: 0.38569862842348044 <br>
Year: 12, Profit Margin: 0.37567830127477263 <br>
Year: 13, Profit Margin: 0.36565797412170076 <br>
